# R-Fairness-Analysis
This repository contains R code to analyze and visualize fairness ratings from a lab experiment. The script reads data from a CSV file, reshapes it for analysis, and creates a violin plot using the ggplot2 package. The plot illustrates the distribution of fairness ratings across different conditions.
